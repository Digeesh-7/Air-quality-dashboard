# Power BI Dashboard For Air Quality

 I've built interactive dashboards that provide insights into air pollution levels across various countries and cities. These dashboards help to visualize key metrics such as:

🌐 Global Air Quality Overview: Analyzes pollution levels and gas compositions worldwide with an interactive map and bar charts.

🌆 City-Level Analysis: Highlights the most polluted cities, gas compositions, and toxicity indexes, allowing users to drill down into specific urban areas.

🇵🇪 Country-Wise Comparison: Compares pollution metrics across countries with a breakdown of average pollution levels and key pollutant types.
